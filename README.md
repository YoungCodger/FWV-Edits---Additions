This is where all of my edits & additions to FWV will be kept. If you can't find something, notify me & I'll help.

Installing these is simple enough, even for me. Unzip the ZIP file you'll download using something like 7-Zip, & just copy & paste or drag the Data folder you'll get from it in your Fallout: New Vegas directory.
