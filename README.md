This is where all of my edits & additions to FWV will be kept. If you can't find something, notify me & I'll help.

Installing these is simple enough, even for me. Unzip the ZIP file you'll download using something like 7-Zip, & just copy & paste or drag the Data folder you'll get from it in your Fallout: New Vegas directory for a manual install, or just add it to your mod organizer of choice, thanks to my past self putting everything in a proper Data directory.

For my All Controls Have SFX Addon, install AllControlsSFX.zip first, then the Classic Who Update, then the New Who Update.

For the Redone Titles, download the version you want & not the other one. If you do, they'll just end up overwriting. If for example, you wanted one version's Title Sequence but the other's ending, then you'll have to download each version & copy & paste them both into the file path they're under if you're modding it manually or ZIP them in a proper pathway to be used in Mod Organizer 2 or somesuch.
